Iâ€™m currently a Research Scientist at [Haiper](https://haiper.ai), where we are building foundation models for text-to-video generation.

I'm interested in multimodal foundation models, generative models, and designing perception systems. My goal is to create interactive world models that can generate photorealistic and explorable environments.

Previously, I worked at Huawei - Noah's Ark Lab on the parameter-efficient tuning and alignment of LLMs.
I did my Computer Science Master's studies at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en) and Concordia University, advised by [Eugene Belilovsky](https://eugenium.github.io/) and collaborating with [Rahaf Aljundi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YLh7yrwAAAAJ&hl=en). I worked on the generalization and continual/decentralized training of deep neural networks.
 
Apart from my research I also enjoy working on open source projects and generative art. Check out my projects for more!

<!-- ##### Research

My research has focused on exploring innovative paradigms for the next generation of large-scale deep learning systems, given any source of supervision. These systems will exhibit continuous growth in modalities (multi-modal learning), tasks (continual learning), and computation (decentralized learning). -->


<!-- ##### Writings

I like sharing my thoughts and writings on machine learning ideas, concepts, and applications on my [Blog](/blog/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/naderasadi_). -->
